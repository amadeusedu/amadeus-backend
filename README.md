# Amadeus Education – Backend Monorepo

This repository is the **scaffold** for every backend component in the Amadeus Education platform.
Each directory already exists so that future code, infrastructure, docs, and tests can be added
incrementally without restructuring.

*No implementation files are included here — you'll commit them as you complete each checklist task.*
